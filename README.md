# Big Data
This repository contains code examples and experiments for performing word count operations on large datasets using PySpark. The goal is to demonstrate how to handle big data efficiently by leveraging Apache Spark's distributed computing capabilities.
Every code is runned 3 times to check the execution time and CPU usage
